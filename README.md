Physiblocks
===========
Physiblocks (fiz - ee - blocks) is twist on the popular Atari game Breakout. In Breakout you play as a paddle and have to bounce a ball on some blocks to destroy them all. This game is very similar however the twist is that the blocks move around using physics. As far as I am aware this is unuique; I haven't seen it before.

But the repo name says...
=========================
Yes, I know. This game was initially supposed to be a breakout game in Unity, for practice. However after forgetting to secure the blocks down I decided to keep them this way. As for how Physiblocks came along, I have no idea

I Wanna Play!
