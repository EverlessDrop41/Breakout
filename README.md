I made a game!

About
-------
Physiblocks (fiz - ee - blocks) is twist on the popular Atari game Breakout. In Breakout you play as a paddle and have to bounce a ball on some blocks to destroy them all. This game is very similar however the twist is that the blocks move around using physics. As far as I am aware this is unuique; I haven't seen it before.

The game is powered by Unity , Unfortunately due to a bug in Unity won't run in WebGL, please bear in mind that the WebGl feature is still in beta.


Dual Paddle

There is a dual paddle game mode available on the non-mobile versions. In this version you have control of two different paddles. The high score is kept in a different file. I decided to keep this out of the mobile version as it's quite complicated to have to control of the second panel without making the screen feel cluttered/ overcrowded

I've been having some problems with Unity Ads, they are definitely implemented but I don't appear to be getting them shown up, if anyone has any experience with Unity Ads could they please post in the comments section.
