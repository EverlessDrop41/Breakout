{"name":"Breakout","tagline":"A simple breakout game which incorperates physics into the blocks","body":"Physiblocks\r\n=========\r\n![Physiblocks Splash](http://i.imgur.com/xfiIzBs.png)\r\n\r\nI made a game!\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-------\r\nPhysiblocks (fiz - ee - blocks) is twist on the popular Atari game Breakout. In Breakout you play as a paddle and have to bounce a ball on some blocks to destroy them all. This game is very similar however the twist is that the blocks move around using physics. As far as I am aware this is unuique; I haven't seen it before.\r\n\r\nThe game is powered by Unity , Unfortunately due to a bug in Unity won't run in WebGL, please bear in mind that the WebGl feature is still in beta.\r\n\r\n\r\nDual Paddle\r\n-------------\r\n![Dual Paddle](http://i.imgur.com/w9MqTsh.png)\r\n\r\nThere is a dual paddle game mode available on the non-mobile versions. In this version you have control of two different paddles. The high score is kept in a different file. I decided to keep this out of the mobile version as it's quite complicated to have to control of the second panel without making the screen feel cluttered/ overcrowded\r\n\r\nWhere to Play\r\n-----------------\r\nThe game is available on the following platforms\r\n\r\n - Unity Web Player\r\n - Windows\r\n - Mac\r\n - Linux (Coming Soon)\r\n - Android (V. 4.0 and up) \r\n\r\nAll of the versions can be found on the [GameJolt Page](http://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/physiblocks/54829/).
